# Homework 8
## Write a program which does:
(a) Generate noisy images with gaussian noise(amplitude of 10 and 30)

(b) Generate noisy images with salt-and-pepper noise( probability 0.1 and 0.05)

(c) Use the 3x3, 5x5 box filter on images generated by (a)(b)

(d) Use 3x3, 5x5 median filter on images generated by (a)(b)

(e) Use both opening-then-closing and closing-then opening filter (using the octogonal 3-5-5-5-3 kernel, value = 0) on images generated by (a)(b)

You must calculate the signal-to-ratio (SNR) for each instance(4 noisy images and 24 processed images)
